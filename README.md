## Summary and Analysis
The car industry is fiercely competitive, with various factors influencing consumer preferences and purchasing decisions. LOCA Auto Merchant's goal is to open a dealership in Mumbai. In an effort to place the best-selling vehicles on the lot, the group is utilizing the car details v4 dataset from kaggle.com. We aim to explore the relationship between certain factors and how that affects the number of vehicles sold - specifically price, make, kilometers, color, and number of owners.

Big cities have diverse demographics, including varying income levels, age groups, and cultural backgrounds. This can influence the car sales by multiple factors. With our dataset cleaned to only show sales in Mumbai, we can see what types of vehicles people in the area have actually purchased. By analyzing the price scatter plot, we can see the correlation that lower prices equal a higher volume of sales, and this is consistent with higher sales of economy vehicles. We are looking to sell used vehicles and buyers are willing to spend up to 65K rupee before interest decreases on the vehicle. Within our dataset we have found that Hyundai and Maruti Suzuki have nearly twice as many sales as their other leading competitors (Mercedes-Benz, Honda, Toyota). The market shows the economy brands have a higher volume of sales. The majority of vehicles sold have less than 60,000 kilometers. More than half of the auto purchases are made by neutral colors (white, silver, gray) with blue and red following closely behind. Lastly, the  vehicle preference also shows a sharp decrease in sales as the number of owners increases.

When deciding to buy a car, consumers consider various important factors, including price, color, number of previous owners, make, and number of kilometers on the car's odometer. To find success in our flagship store, we need to consider this when choosing the vehicles to put on the lot.
